# complaints app

https://hgarciasoftware.github.io/complaints-app/

### while making this app i learned:

- more about the viewport meta tag

### and i got more practice with:

- grid and flex layouts

- positioning

### and i took inspiration from:

- https://dribbble.com/shots/5402553-Complaint-Analysis-Table-View

- https://dribbble.com/shots/16102470-Help-Center-Existing-Tickets-Exploration

- https://www.brendanlong.com/setting-a-minimum-viewport-width-for-responsive-pages.html

### there's a lot that could still be done, like:

- [ ] adding maps and markers that show where each complaint was made

- [ ] counting and displaying how many times each complaint descriptor shows up

- [ ] indicating which borough's complaints is currently being listed

- [ ] making the layout mobile-friendly
